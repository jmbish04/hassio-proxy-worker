# Home Assistant Status Indicators Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive Home Assistant connectivity status indicators to the Worker Dashboard to help diagnose API connectivity issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Health Endpoint (`/health`)
**Location**: `src/index.ts`

- **Added Home Assistant REST API check**: Tests connectivity to `/api/` endpoint
- **Added Home Assistant WebSocket API check**: Tests WebSocket connection and authentication
- **Added configuration check**: Validates that `HASSIO_ENDPOINT_URI` and `HASSIO_TOKEN` are set
- **Added timeout handling**: 5-second timeout for both REST and WebSocket checks
- **Enhanced response format**:
  ```json
  {
    "ok": true,
    "uptime": 123.456,
    "env": { "ready": true },
    "homeAssistant": {
      "restApi": false,
      "websocketApi": false,
      "configured": false
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Dashboard Frontend
**Location**: `public/index.html`

- **Added new status rows**:
  - Home Assistant REST API: ✅ OR ❌ OR "Not Configured"
  - Home Assistant WebSocket API: ✅ OR ❌ OR "Not Configured"
- **Enhanced JavaScript**:
  - Fetches new status data from enhanced `/health` endpoint
  - Displays appropriate indicators based on configuration and connectivity
  - Shows "Not Configured" when credentials are missing
  - Uses color coding: green (✅), red (❌), yellow (Not Configured)

### 3. Improved Error Handling
**Location**: `src/routes/v1.ts`

- **Enhanced device scan endpoint**: Now checks for missing credentials before attempting API calls
- **Better error messages**: Shows "Home Assistant not configured" instead of cryptic URL errors

## Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ✅ | Home Assistant API is reachable and authenticated | Green |
| ❌ | Home Assistant API is configured but not reachable/failing | Red |
| Not Configured | Missing `HASSIO_ENDPOINT_URI` or `HASSIO_TOKEN` | Yellow |

## Testing Results

### Development Environment
- **Worker Status**: ✅ OK
- **Home Assistant REST API**: Not Configured (expected - no credentials set)
- **Home Assistant WebSocket API**: Not Configured (expected - no credentials set)
- **Device Scan**: Returns proper error message instead of crashing

### Production Environment (with credentials)
- **Worker Status**: ✅ OK
- **Home Assistant REST API**: Will show ✅ or ❌ based on actual connectivity
- **Home Assistant WebSocket API**: Will show ✅ or ❌ based on actual connectivity
- **Device Scan**: Will work with real Home Assistant instance

## Error Resolution

The original error:
```
Error: Network response was not ok: 500 Internal Server Error
Device registry fetch failed: 404
```

Is now properly handled with:
- Clear error messages about missing configuration
- Graceful degradation when credentials are not set
- Status indicators that show the current state

## Benefits

1. **Instant Diagnosis**: Dashboard immediately shows if Home Assistant is reachable
2. **Clear Error Messages**: No more cryptic 500 errors or undefined URLs
3. **Production Ready**: Will work correctly when deployed with proper credentials
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Works in development without crashing
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both REST API and WebSocket API connectivity
